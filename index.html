        <h1 class="heading">About <span>MADHUBAlA</span></h1>

        <p><span class="big">‘The Marilyn Monroe of Bollywood’</span> Madhubala was a gifted actor and
            was known for her beauty, personality, and sensitive portrayals of women in films.
            Born in Delhi on this day in 1933, Mumtaz Jehan Begum Dehlavi was raised in a town
            located near the Bombay Talkies film studio. She appeared in her first film at the
            age of 9, billed as Baby Mumtaz.
            Her first major role, at the age of 16, was as the leading lady in the 1949
            film ‘Mahal’ opposite Ashok Kumar. She died at the mere age of 36 leaving behind
            her dazzling career.
            Raised in the slums of Bombay, she supported her family as a child star and soon
            became a leading lady known for her elegance on-screen and considerable acting abilities.
            In 1947, she landed the lead role in Neel Kamal at the age of 14, taking the name Madhubala.
            As the family’s main breadwinner, she worked tirelessly to support her parents and four sisters.
            She famously fell in love with actor Dilip Kumar, her co-star in cult classic Mughal-E-Azam (1960).
            Her character as Anarkali and the chemistry with Kumar, who essayed the role of Salim, is still
            remembered and etched in millions of hearts across the country.</p>

        <p>Madhubala appeared in nine films during 1949, including a spellbinding breakout performance
            in the box office hit Mahal. Appearing in over 70 films over the course of a tragically brief
            career, Madhubala — who would have turned 86 today — was called “The Biggest Star in the World”
            in 1952 by Theatre Arts magazine. Madhubala’s fledgling career and life were cut short when she
            breathed her last on February 23, 1969, due to prolonged illness. In 2008, the legendary actress
            appeared on a commemorative postage stamp in India, where she is remembered by many as one of the
            greatest to ever grace the silver screen.</p>

                    <h2>Epitome of Love: Iconic Madhubala-Dilip Kumar love story !</h2>
                    <p>"Was I in love with Madhubala as the newspapers and magazines reported at that time?
                        As an answer to this oft-repeated question straight from the horse's mouth, I must
                        admit that I was attracted to her both as a fine co-star and as a person who had
                        some of the attributes I hoped to find in a woman at that age and time. She, as
                        I said earlier, was very sprightly and vivacious and, as such, she could draw
                        me out of my shyness and reticence effortlessly. She filled a void that was
                        crying out to be filled - not by an intellectually sharp woman but a spirited
                        woman whose liveliness and charm were the ideal panacea for the wound that
                        was taking its own time to heal." </p>
                    <p>"Matters began to sour between us, thanks to her father's attempt to make the
                        proposed marriage a business venture. The outcome was that half way through
                        the production of Mughal-e-Azam, we were not even talking to each other.
                        The classic scene with the feather coming between our lips, which set a
                        million imaginations on fire, was shot when we had completely stopped
                        even greeting each other."</p>

                    <h2>Life of Unending Tragedies: Madhubala-Kishore Kumar marriage !</h2>
                    <p>Today, if Madhubala stands for boundless beauty, it also stands for
                        limitless pain. However, very few could see that side of the actress, whose
                        ethereal face continues to be the ultimate parameter of beauty in Bollywood.
                        "Her face is a rare combination of innocence and mischief. You could never predict
                        when one will give way to the other," says Sushila Kumari, who has written about
                        Madhubala's painful journey in her biography, Madhubala - Dard Ka Safar
                        According to Zahida, "Madhubala married Kishore Kumar out of stubbornness, and
                        anger towards Dilipsaab."</p>
                    <p>However, it turned out, that the actress had a severe condition of cyanosis
                        and poor oxygen perfusion, which in layman's terms is called "hole in the heart."
                        The medical community's understanding of the condition was in its nascent stages,
                        and there was no available treatment.
                        Health wasn't the only battle Madhubala had to fight. On one hand she was fighting
                        for her life and trying to do justice to her films, on the other hand, she was dealing
                        with a tumultuous personal life. She was in love with Dilip Kumar. Their relationship
                        crashed and burned, as her father wasn't happy with it.</p>
